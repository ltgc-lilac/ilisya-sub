00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.045
Order.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:57.498
Grace.

00:00:58.345 --> 00:00:59.626
Desire.

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:02.366
The 3 foundations of life,

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.123
embodied by 3 goddesses.

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:06.302
Mery

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:08.451
Diem

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.024
and Shyume.

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:15.232
Mery established order,

00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:17.503
by shaping the earth and the bodies.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.334
Diem,

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.274
breathed grace into this world

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:24.782
thus giving it life.

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.953
Finally,

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:31.183
Shyume inspired desire into the living,

00:01:31.183 --> 00:01:35.251
to push it to advance, evolve and accomplish.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.114
This world thus created,

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.109
the goddesses divided it into three.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.530
Mery organized an ordered and hierarchical civilization

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.603
where trust and strength reigned.

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:48.130
Diem

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.725
created an equitable society, based on development and exchange.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:54.111
Shyume

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.107
formed a group of individuals free to act as they please,

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.178
thus cultivating their desires.

00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:02.489
Thus prospered for a time, what would become...

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:06.842
Irisya!

00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:09.903
I can't wait to be there!

00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:11.036
Do you realize Ashe?

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:14.158
The original kingdom, at the center of everything!

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:17.772
With its crystals, its landscapes, its extraordinary people,

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:20.519
the radiance and above all the specialists!

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:23.020
Yes Kalya I know,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.106
you've told me five times since we've been here.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.395
Six!

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.667
I counted too...

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.608
But I've wanted to go there for years

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.219
and it's very expensive and regulated,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.072
it's so exciting to be there.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.040
Despite everything,

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.364
it still bothers me that you offered me such a gift for my birthday.

00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:45.057
Don't worry... It's paid thanks to my last bonus,

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:46.627
relax and enjoy!

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:48.741
I know!

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.734
I said it to see you smile.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.773
With your new look of a rich, classy and inaccessible businesswoman there...

00:02:57.758 --> 00:02:59.859
I told you that I have clients in Essencia,

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.592
I have to make a good impression if I meet them.

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:04.135
I know the imposture ma'am...

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:05.410
Besides,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.867
you could have taken first class tickets.

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.006
Watch your tone, Kalya.

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:13.203
Oops,

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:14.890
forgive me Ashe.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.292
I hope I can meet your standards in the future.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.479
Your attention please.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.110
We are approaching Essencia,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.799
our arrival point.

00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:32.950
Finally.

00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:53.773
Your thing is strong there.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.282
Wait, it's awful...

00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:59.387
Excuse me,

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.211
could we do it again please?

00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.577
Please move forward, miss.

00:04:09.134 --> 00:04:10.076
Go ahead,

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:11.309
it deserves to be redone.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.132
Thanks!

00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:19.451
Hello and welcome to Essencia.

00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:21.998
The capital of Irisya is delighted to welcome you

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:24.296
and provide you with

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:25.944
a Personal Radiance Reserve as part of your stay.

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:30.000
Once around your paw it will allow you to use this energy,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.699
even if you are not Irisyan.

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.354
Don't forget your one-hour training offered at the royal agency in the city center.

00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:39.071
You can then make the most out of your stay and stay safe.

00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.060
Perhaps are you already a future renowned specialist?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.045
Hahaha...

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:44.271
Nah, it was a joke.

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:49.836
This is new...

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:54.627
Even their residence permits are cool.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.116
I knew you would like it,

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:58.523
but it was much longer than my last visit.

00:04:58.877 --> 00:05:00.410
I thought we would spend the day there.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:04.267
Yes, but we're finally done.

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:06.825
Plus we have a Personal Radiance Reserve!

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:14.745
All we have to do is find our hotel in the center so we can relax a bit.

00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:17.189
With first class we would already be there.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:20.000
I wonder if I shouldn't have taken it in the end...

00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:21.831
It's okay...

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:24.154
That way we can see the less pompous neighborhoods,

00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:26.525
so we're not too out of place.

00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:33.533
Wave alert, take shelter in the nearest building as quickly as possible.

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:35.576
Ashe,

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:37.010
what's going on?

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.317
You! Come quickly!

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:40.500
The exterior barrier will not be deployed in time,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.653
we will be hit!

00:05:50.843 --> 00:05:52.795
That wasn't in the brochure...

00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:17.484
I should have taken first class.

00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:51.673
Kalya?

00:06:52.165 --> 00:06:54.031
No, no, no no...

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:55.566
Kalya!

00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:57.702
Is anyone here?

00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.349
She needs help!

00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:46.049
We have located the civilians!

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:55.074
Unusual presence of an ashblade.

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.072
Request for immediate reinforcements to my position.

00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:02.682
One of the two civilians is unconscious and injured,

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:04.307
immediate extraction!

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:56.714
Shit...
